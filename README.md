Documentation and Support
-------------------------
Concept:
When estimating the duration of tasks it is difficult to know whether to be realistic or safe.  Is it going to take 2 days ("on average this feels about right") or will it take 4 days ("It doesnt take much to make it a bigger task").  The estimation problem is exacerbated when there are a number of tasks, each with their own level of risk, adding into an overall project.

If we assume the worst case it will be woefully over estimated (and, by the way, that estimate will become a self-fullfilling prophesy).  If we assume the average we are asking for trouble at least half the time.

But risk will materialise with some taks and not others.  The Theory of Constrains (see Critical Chain by Eli Goldratt) encourages us to pool that risk to provide a 'buffer' sufficient to allow for some of the risk to occur without impacting our deadline.  We still work to the 'average' but protect expectations.

The ToC Calculator helps assess the level of 'buffer' to be applied to your project.
